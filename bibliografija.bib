	abstract = {Recommender systems are tools for interacting with large and complex information spaces. They provide a personalized view of such spaces, prioritizing items likely to be of interest to the user. The field, christened in 1995, has grown enormously in the variety of problems addressed and techniques employed, as well as in its practical applications. Recommender systems research has incorporated a wide variety of artificial intelligence techniques including machine learning, data mining, user modeling, case‐based reasoning, and constraint satisfaction, among others. Personalized recommendations are an important part of many online e‐commerce applications such as Amazon.com, Netflix, and Pandora. This wealth of practical application experience has provided inspiration to researchers to extend the reach of recommender systems into new and challenging areas. The purpose of the articles in this special issue is to take stock of the current landscape of recommender systems research and identify directions the field is now taking. This article provides an overview of the current state of the field and introduces the various articles in the special issue.},

Numbers generally tell most, if not all of the story.  For example, if you’re wondering why Amazon continues to grow, one might point to their 83/100 average customer satisfaction score, which comes from their dedication to the customer experience.

	shorttitle = {How much is too much?},
	abstract = {Social media provide many opportunities to connect people; however, the kinds of personally identifiable information that people share through social media is understudied. Such public discussions of personal information warrant a closer privacy discussion. This paper presents findings from a content analysis of Twitter in which the amount and kinds of personally identifiable information in Twitter messages were coded. Findings suggest that the majority of time Twitterers do write about themselves. Overwhelmingly, Twitterers do not include identifiable information such as phone numbers, email and home addresses. However, about a quarter of tweets do include information regarding when people are engaging in activities and where they are. This kind of information may have privacy implications when found in the same tweet or if coupled with other kinds of publicly available information. {PRIVACY} {ON} {TWITTER} 3 How much is too much? Privacy issues on Twitter Social media provide many people a new way to connect with friends, family and colleagues. In particular, social network sites are frequently used to communicate with people known to one another through offline connections (Ellison, Steinfield, \& Lampe, 2007). For example, as of August 2009, Facebook was the fifth most frequented website in the {US} ({ComScore}, 2009). These services can help to reinforce social bonds and manage social},

Through a study of the top 10K websites, our findings indicate that {OSN} tracking is diffused among almost all website categories, independently from the content and from the audience. We also evaluate the tracking capabilities in practice and demonstrate by analyzing a real traffic traces that {OSNs} can reconstruct a significant portion of users web profile and browsing history. We finally provide insights into the relation between the browsing history characteristics and the {OSN} tracking potential, highlighting the high risk properties.},
